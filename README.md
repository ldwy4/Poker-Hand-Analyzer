# Poker Hand Analyzer

## 1.0
My personal project for CPSC 210.

This is a poker hand analyzer that will display odds in real time as the user add cards to the board.
I was inspired to make this program because a few friends of mine played poker and even though I'm not that good, I am very interested in the game.
So I decided that I would make something which could be useful for both beginners and experienced players.
I think any person that's interested in poker or in probability would be someone who could you this application.

Features:
- Allows user to **add** cards to their hand and/or opponents or have hands randomly generated
- Allows user to **change** their hand and/or their opponents hand
- Allows user to **view** the odds of their hand of winning
- Allows user to **add** cards to the table
- Allows user to **choose** what cards get placed on the board or have board cards randomly generated
